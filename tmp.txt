Wishlist:

ADD ESR and SRF data to the unified sheet.
Add last updated database date.
Add last updated website date.
Run a cron script to update the database.

Restructure the code to make it more maintainable. 

Add a 1-line “What this does” at top: “Find the smallest-volume MLCC combo that meets derated capacitance at your DC bias.”
Add selection presets for common applications.
Add a toggle: Show top 50 / 100 / 1000. Default 50 for speed.
Add an inset of murata cap curve read from the csv file when hovered.
Show the dataset timestamp and source once (small footer).

Add TDK and Samsung capacitor data. But make sure to correct the murata capacitor height to nominal height for a fair comparison.

Inset the capacitor curves in the website when clicked.

Add buttons to allow for capacitor series-ing and parallel-ing.

Mimic the digikey portal with inputs on the top bar and results in the main window. The surf plot can be on the right side.

Adaptive nuumber of columns based on the cap types selected.

Control over how many results are shown.

One large tick button to unselect all extended size packages.

Add nominal thickness instead of max thickness.
Allow filtering for packages, codes, temperature, etc 
add ignore list if someone doesnt wna tot use a certain capacitor
Make one page flow ppt

Hide advanced options like ESR and frequency and minimum operating voltage in the dropdow

It would be so cool to put a contour plot of nearby capacitor and voltage values one can pick if significant advantage in size is obtained.
Clicking on the plot point should populate the values in the input fields.
